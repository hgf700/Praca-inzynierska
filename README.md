# Praca Inżynierska

This project is my engineering thesis developed at the university.

## Overview

The main goal of the project is to simulate and optimize solutions for the **job scheduling problem** using a combination of:

1. **Random Data Generation** – Generate job/task datasets in CSV format.
2. **Genetic Algorithm** – Evolve task schedules to improve fitness values over generations.
3. **Neural Network** – A trained model evaluates and rates the quality of generated schedules.

## Key Components

- Random job data generator (CSV format)
- Genetic algorithm implementation for optimization
- Fitness function tracking performance over iterations
- Neural network trained to rate/score the scheduling solutions

## Technologies

- Python (or specify your language)
- NumPy / Pandas
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (if used)
- Matplotlib (for result visualization, if any)

## Purpose

To explore how evolutionary algorithms and neural networks can be combined to optimize complex scheduling problems.
