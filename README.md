# Praca Inżynierska / Enginering Thesis

This repository contains my engineering thesis project developed at the university.
The project focuses on solving and optimizing the Job Scheduling Problem using a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks.

## Overview

The main goal of the project is to simulate and optimize solutions for the **job scheduling problem** using a combination of:

1. **Random Data Generation** – Generate job/task datasets in CSV format.
2. **Genetic Algorithm** – Evolve task schedules to improve fitness values over generations.
3. **Neural Network** – A trained model evaluates and rates the quality of generated schedules.

## Key Components

- Random job data generator (CSV format)
- Genetic algorithm implementation for optimization
- Fitness function tracking performance over iterations
- Neural network trained to rate/score the scheduling solutions
- Experimentation and visualization using Jupyter Notebook

## Programming Language
- Python - implementation usage of neural networks and data processing
- C# - frontend using WPF and logic for the genetic algorithm

## Core Libraries
- NumPy – numerical computations
- Pandas – data processing and CSV handling
- scikit-learn – initial experiments and data preprocessing
- TensorFlow – neural network implementation
- Matplotlib – result visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – interactive experimentation and visualization

## Purpose

To explore how evolutionary algorithms and neural networks can be combined to optimize complex scheduling problems.
